# Choose Together Privacy Policy
Thank you for choosing our software! We respect your privacy rights and care about protecting your information collected by our app. In general, when we say “Choose Together,” “our,” “we,” or “us,” we are referring to the developers of Choose Together or the app itself.

Our Privacy Policy was posted on 18 June 2017 and last updated on 18 June 2017. This governs the privacy terms of our Android app, Choose Together. By signing into our app and choosing to use our service, you agree to the collection and use of information in relation with this policy.

## Your Privacy

Choose Together follows all legal requirements to protect your privacy. Our Privacy Policy is a legal statement that explains how we may collect information from you, how we may share your information, and how you can limit our sharing of your information. Generally, we use your Personal Information only for operation within the app and we do not share that information with other third party entities.

You will see terms in our Privacy Policy that are capitalized. These terms have meanings as described in the Definitions section below.

## Definitions

"Personally Identifiable Information or Personal Information” is non-public information that is personally identifiable to you and obtained for use within the app. Personally Identifiable Information may include information such as your name, email address, and other related information acquired from the Google account you signed in with.

"Non-Personal Information" is information that is not personally identifiable to you and may be automatically collect when you sign into Choose Together. It may also include publicly available information that is shared between you and others.

## Information We Collect

Choose Together collects your Personal Information only with your consent, which you agree to give us when you sign in with a Google account. From this account, we collect and save the minimum amount of Personal Information that is necessary to fulfill the purpose of your interaction with us. This includes only three(3) basic information: 1) the account’s user name, 2) the account’s email address, and 3) the account’s profile photo. This information is automatically updated with each app sign in.

All mutable data you add or modify in Choose Together is stored on our Google Firebase Database which includes, but not limited to, group names, choice names, and chat messages. This data will be retained indefinitely until it is manually deleted by the user within the app. We reserve the right to delete any and/or all data if we deem it necessary, but will not do so without legitimate reason.

**Why do we collect this?** 
<br />
We use the collected Personal Information solely to identify you on the app when communicating with other users. Other Non-Personal Information may be collected to help us improve the app and services for you.

## Managing Your Personal Information

Your Personal Information on Choose Together is automatically collected from the Google account you signed in with and cannot be changed directly in the app. However, you can control the type of information you provide to us by modifying them in your Google account.

## Information We DO NOT Collect

We do not intentionally collect sensitive Personal Information in our app. Although Choose Together does not request or intentionally collect any sensitive Personal Information, we realize that you might use this kind of information during normal usage of our app, such as with group names or choice text. If you choose to use any sensitive Personal Information in our app, you are consenting to our storage of that information in our database.

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information we receive from you as follows:

* **Personalize Your Experience**<br />The basic Personal Information we collect from your Google account is only used within the app to give the app your identity when you sign in and generally will not be seen by other people outside of the app, including Choose Together’s developers (with the exception noted below).

* **Communicate with Other Users**<br />One(1) or more of your basic information may be displayed to other users when using the social aspect of the app, including users who may not be on your accepted friends list. For example: Group members using the “Show Members” feature will be able to see all pending and accepted group members’ user names and profile pictures.
  * **Instant Messages**<br />Messages sent inside a group’s “chat box” can only be seen by members belonging to that specific group. Newly added members will be able to see all past messages entered prior to them joining the group. A member who is removed from the group, leaves the group voluntarily, or deletes the group will no longer have access to these messages. Only the original user who entered the message can delete the message manually. However, all group messages are deleted if the owner of the group (aka the group admin) decides to delete the entire group. Chat message are considered mutable data and follows the guidelines mentioned in the **Information We Collect** section above. We do not have control over the content of these messages, which can consist of 80 characters or less, emojis, and/or links to other websites. All chat messages are encoded before being saved on the database.

* **Your Content**<br />Please be aware and vigilant about the content you share with other users, especially if that includes sensitive Personal Information. By using and signing into Choose Together, you understand and agree that you will own and be solely responsible for Your Content.

* **Legally Required Releases of Information**<br />We may be legally required to disclose your Personally Identifiable Information, if such disclosure is (a) required by subpoena, law, or other legal process; (b) necessary to assist law enforcement officials or government enforcement agencies; (c) necessary to investigate violations of or otherwise enforce our Legal Terms; (d) necessary to protect us from legal action or claims from third parties including you and/or other Members; and/or (e) necessary to protect the legal rights, personal/real property, or personal safety of TermsFeed, our Users, employees, and affiliates.

## Security

The collected information is stored on Google’s Firebase Database and protected with a set of advanced security rules. The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Third Party Providers and Tracking Tools

Choose Together requires a Google account to sign in and uses Google Firebase to store, organize, and manage all data utilized in the app. By default, Google Firebase has utilities for diagnosing problems with the app, monitor app performance issues, and gathers various analytical data to help us improve our app service to you.

Choose Together DOES NOT sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your information to other third party entities or companies, nor do we use any Third Party Tracking Tools.

## Protecting Your Child's Privacy

Our app was designed to be used by anyone with a Google account. We realize this may occasionally include children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect Personal Identifiable Information from these children. Please note that we do not actively monitor any communications between users of the app. If you are a Child, please seek the permission of a parent or guardian before using our app and do not join groups that include users you do not know or add unknown users to your friends list. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your Child is having inappropriate communications with other users on our app or simply do not want your child to be using our app, please contact us to block your Child's account; we reserve the right to ask you for verification of your relationship to the Child before we honor such a request.

## Privacy Policy Updates

We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. You should review this Privacy Policy periodically for changes. If we make material changes to this policy, we may notify you within the app, by email, or by any other method we deem necessary and appropriate. The method we choose is at our sole discretion. We will also change the "Last Updated" date at the beginning of this Privacy Policy. Any changes we make to our Privacy Policy are effective as of this Last Updated date and replace any prior Privacy Policies. Your continued use of the app after we post any modifications to the Privacy Policy on this page will constitute your acknowledgment of the modifications and your consent to abide and be bound by the modified Privacy Policy.
